# Pull Request Review

Review a pull request specified by the user input of "$ARGUMENTS". Verify the user input matches the format "<github_org>/<github_repo>/pull/<pull_request_number>", the shorthand form "<github_org>/<github_repo>#<pull_request_number>, or a full github.com URL pointing to a specific pull request.

Confirm the pull request to be reviewed with the user before proceeding.

Use the **Pull Request Review** skill to conduct the review. For repository-specific guidelines, check if there are progressive content skills available for the specific repository being reviewed
