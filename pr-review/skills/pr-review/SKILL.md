# Pull Request Review Workflow

This skill guides comprehensive PR reviews using the GitHub CLI and local code analysis.

## 1. Setup and Prerequisites

**Clone repository locally:**
```bash
gh repo clone <github_org>/<github_repo> pr-<github_org>-<github_repo>-<pr_number>
cd pr-<github_org>-<github_repo>-<pr_number>
```

**Fetch and checkout the PR:**
```bash
gh pr checkout <pr_number>
```

**Check CI status:**
```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json statusCheckRollup
```

If CI checks are failing, ask the user whether to continue or wait for green CI.

**CRITICAL SAFETY**: Never run code from the PR. It may contain untrusted code. Only read and analyze files.

## 2. Gather PR Context

**Fetch PR details:**
```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json title,body,commits,comments,reviews,files
```

Extract and note:
- PR title and description
- Number of commits and commit messages
- Files changed
- Existing comments and reviews
- Any unaddressed review comments

**Identify unaddressed comments:**
Look for review comments that:
- Have no replies from the PR author
- Requested changes that weren't made
- Raised concerns not acknowledged
- Are marked as unresolved

Flag these prominently in your review.

## 3. Analyze Code Changes

**Get the diff:**
```bash
gh pr diff <pr_number>
```

For large PRs (>500 lines changed), break the review into logical sections (e.g., by file, by functionality).

**Review each changed file systematically:**

Use Read, Grep, and Glob tools to examine:
- Changed files and surrounding context
- Related files that might be affected
- Test files for the changed code
- Documentation for updated features

**Apply review checklist:**

For comprehensive criteria, see `reference/review-checklist.md`. Key areas:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Readability and maintainability
   - Follows project conventions
   - Appropriate abstraction levels
   - Error handling

2. **Correctness**
   - Logic is sound
   - Edge cases handled
   - No obvious bugs
   - Changes align with PR description

3. **Testing**
   - Tests included for new functionality
   - Tests cover edge cases
   - Existing tests still pass
   - Test quality is adequate

4. **Security**
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Input validation present
   - No exposed secrets or credentials
   - Safe handling of user data

5. **Performance**
   - No obvious performance issues
   - Efficient algorithms
   - No unnecessary operations
   - Database queries optimized

6. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Public API changes are compatible
   - Database migrations are safe
   - Configuration changes documented
   - Deprecation handled properly

7. **Documentation**
   - Code comments where needed
   - API docs updated
   - README updated if needed
   - Breaking changes documented

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Check alignment with PR description:**
- All described changes are present
- No undescribed significant changes
- Commit messages match changes

**Verify comments match code:**
- Inline comments are accurate
- No outdated comments from refactoring
- Documentation reflects actual behavior

**Assess scope creep:**
- Changes are focused on stated goal
- No unrelated refactoring
- Separate concerns properly

## 5. Categorize Findings

Use the severity guide in `reference/severity-guide.md` to categorize each finding:

- **Critical**: Must fix before merge (security, data loss, breaking changes)
- **High**: Should fix before merge (bugs, significant issues)
- **Medium**: Should address but not blocking (code quality, minor issues)
- **Low**: Optional improvements (style, suggestions)

Be specific about:
- What the issue is
- Why it matters
- How to fix it (or suggest approaches)
- File and line references

## 6. Generate Review Report

Write findings to `./pr_review_results.md` using the template in `templates/review-report.md`.

**Report structure:**
1. Executive summary
2. Unaddressed comments from others
3. Findings by severity
4. Positive observations
5. Final recommendation (approve/request changes/needs discussion)

**Key principles:**
- Be constructive and specific
- Include code references (file:line)
- Distinguish blockers from suggestions
- Highlight what's done well
- Provide actionable guidance

## 7. Present to User

After writing `./pr_review_results.md`, present:
1. Summary of key findings
2. Number of issues by severity
3. Critical blockers if any
4. Any unaddressed comments from others
5. Overall recommendation

Ask if the user wants:
- Details on any specific finding
- To focus on particular aspects
- To leave review comments on GitHub

## Repository-Specific Customization

This skill supports repository-specific review criteria. When reviewing PRs, check if custom guidelines exist for the repository.

### Adding Custom Guidelines

To add repository-specific rules:

1. Identify the repository pattern (org/repo)
2. Add a section below with specific criteria
3. Include architecture patterns, conventions, or requirements

### Example: Custom Repository Rules

**For llamastack/llama-stack:**
- Verify API changes maintain backward compatibility
- Check distributed system considerations (race conditions, eventual consistency)
- Ensure proper error propagation across component boundaries
- Validate integration points follow established patterns
- Confirm performance impact is acceptable for distributed workloads

**For your-org/your-repo:**
- Add your specific criteria here
- Architecture patterns to verify
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Performance benchmarks

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don't guess**: If you can't determine something from the code, note it as a question
- **Don't run code**: Security risk - only read and analyze
- **Don't be vague**: "This looks wrong" â†’ "This function doesn't handle null inputs (see line 42)"
- **Don't forget context**: Read surrounding code to understand intent
- **Don't ignore tests**: Test quality matters as much as code quality

## Validation Checklist

Before completing the review, ensure:
- [ ] PR context gathered (description, comments, reviews)
- [ ] All changed files examined
- [ ] Unaddressed comments identified
- [ ] All review checklist areas covered
- [ ] Findings categorized by severity
- [ ] Review report written to `./pr_review_results.md`
- [ ] Specific file:line references included
- [ ] Actionable recommendations provided
- [ ] Positive aspects noted
- [ ] Final recommendation clear

## Extending This Skill

This skill is designed to be customized:

1. **Add review criteria**: Edit `reference/review-checklist.md`
2. **Adjust severity definitions**: Modify `reference/severity-guide.md`
3. **Customize report format**: Update `templates/review-report.md`
4. **Add repository rules**: Add sections to this file or create repository-specific reference files

The goal is a thorough, actionable review that helps maintain code quality while being respectful and constructive.
