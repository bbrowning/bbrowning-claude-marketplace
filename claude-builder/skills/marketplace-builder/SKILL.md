# Claude Code Marketplace Builder

## What is a Marketplace?

A marketplace is a collection of Claude Code plugins that can be shared as a cohesive unit. Marketplaces enable:
- Centralized distribution of multiple related plugins
- Version control and sharing via git repositories
- Team-wide or community-wide plugin discovery
- Organized collections of plugins by theme, team, or purpose

## Marketplace Directory Structure

A marketplace follows this structure:

```
my-marketplace/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json      # Marketplace manifest (REQUIRED)
├── plugin-one/
│   └── .claude-plugin/
│       └── plugin.json       # Individual plugin manifest
├── plugin-two/
│   └── .claude-plugin/
│       └── plugin.json
└── README.md                 # Documentation (recommended)
```

### Key Points

- Marketplace manifest must be at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in the marketplace root
- Each plugin within the marketplace has its own `plugin.json` manifest
- Plugins can be in any subdirectory structure you prefer
- Git version control is recommended for sharing and collaboration

## Marketplace Manifest (marketplace.json)

### Location and Requirements

The marketplace manifest MUST be located at:
```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

This file defines the marketplace metadata and lists all available plugins.

### Required Fields

```json
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Your Name"
  },
  "plugins": []
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `name`: Marketplace identifier in kebab-case (e.g., "team-tools", "data-science-plugins")
- `owner.name`: Maintainer's name (REQUIRED)
- `owner.email`: Maintainer's email (OPTIONAL)
- `plugins`: Array of plugin entries (can be empty initially)

### Optional Metadata Fields

```json
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "description": "Marketplace description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "you@example.com"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/username/marketplace",
  "plugins": []
}
```

**Additional Fields:**
- `description`: Brief overview of the marketplace's purpose
- `version`: Marketplace version (semantic versioning)
- `homepage`: URL to marketplace documentation or repository

## Adding Plugins to Marketplace

### Plugin Entry Structure

Each plugin in the `plugins` array requires:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "source": "./plugin-directory",
      "description": "Brief description"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Plugin Entry Fields:**
- `name`: Plugin identifier (MUST match the plugin's `plugin.json` name)
- `source`: Path or URL to plugin (see Plugin Sources section)
- `description`: Brief description (optional but recommended for discoverability)

### Example with Multiple Plugins

```json
{
  "name": "team-productivity",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Engineering Team"
  },
  "description": "Productivity tools for our engineering team",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "code-review-helper",
      "source": "./code-review-helper",
      "description": "Automated code review assistance"
    },
    {
      "name": "pr-templates",
      "source": "./pr-templates",
      "description": "Standardized PR templates and workflows"
    },
    {
      "name": "testing-utils",
      "source": "./testing-utils",
      "description": "Test generation and coverage tools"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Plugin Sources

Plugin sources in marketplace.json support multiple formats:

### Local Path (Relative)

```json
{
  "name": "local-plugin",
  "source": "./local-plugin"
}
```

Use for plugins stored within the marketplace directory. Paths must be relative to the marketplace root.

### GitHub Repository

```json
{
  "name": "github-plugin",
  "source": "github:username/repo"
}
```

Use for plugins hosted on GitHub. Claude Code will clone the repository.

### Git URL

```json
{
  "name": "git-plugin",
  "source": "https://github.com/username/repo.git"
}
```

Use for plugins hosted on any Git provider. Full git URLs are supported.

### Mixed Sources Example

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "internal-tool",
      "source": "./internal-tool",
      "description": "Internal team tool"
    },
    {
      "name": "community-plugin",
      "source": "github:community/awesome-plugin",
      "description": "Community-maintained plugin"
    },
    {
      "name": "external-tool",
      "source": "https://gitlab.com/team/tool.git",
      "description": "External Git repository"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Creating a Marketplace: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Create Marketplace Directory

```bash
mkdir my-marketplace
cd my-marketplace
```

### Step 2: Create Marketplace Manifest

```bash
mkdir .claude-plugin
```

Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Your Name"
  },
  "plugins": []
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize Git (Recommended)

```bash
git init
```

Version control enables:
- Easy sharing via repository URL
- Version history tracking
- Collaboration workflows
- Distribution to users

### Step 4: Add Plugins

For each plugin you want to include:

1. Create plugin directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-plugin
   mkdir my-plugin/.claude-plugin
   ```

2. Create plugin manifest (my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-plugin",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "Plugin description"
   }
   ```

3. Add plugin components (skills, commands, agents, etc.)

4. Update marketplace.json:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "my-plugin",
         "source": "./my-plugin",
         "description": "Plugin description"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Test Locally

Add marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/my-marketplace
```

Install and test plugins:

```bash
/plugin install my-plugin@my-marketplace
```

Verify installation:
- Run `/plugin` to see installed plugins
- Check `/help` for new commands
- Test plugin functionality

## Local Development Workflow

### Testing Changes

When modifying plugins in your marketplace:

1. **Uninstall old version:**
   ```bash
   /plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
   ```

2. **Reinstall updated version:**
   ```bash
   /plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
   ```

Alternatively, restart Claude Code to reload all plugins.

### Development Iteration

Recommended workflow:
1. Make changes to plugin files
2. Uninstall → Reinstall plugin
3. Test functionality
4. Commit changes to git
5. Repeat as needed

### Debugging

Use debug mode to troubleshoot:

```bash
claude --debug
```

This shows:
- Marketplace loading status
- Plugin loading status
- Manifest validation errors
- Component registration
- Any warnings or errors

## Distribution and Sharing

### Sharing Your Marketplace

1. **Commit to git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add marketplace with plugins"
   ```

2. **Push to remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Share with users:**
   Users add your marketplace:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add <repository-url>
   ```

   Or for local paths:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add /path/to/marketplace
   ```

4. **Install plugins:**
   ```bash
   /plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
   ```

### Managing Plugin Lifecycle

Users can manage installed plugins:

```bash
# Enable plugin
/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name

# Disable plugin
/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name

# Uninstall plugin
/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

## Testing Checklist

Before distributing your marketplace:

- [ ] marketplace.json has required fields (name, owner, plugins)
- [ ] All plugin entries have name and source
- [ ] Plugin names match their plugin.json names
- [ ] Local plugin paths are relative and start with `./`
- [ ] All plugins install without errors
- [ ] Tested with `claude --debug` for warnings
- [ ] README.md documents marketplace purpose and plugins
- [ ] Repository is properly initialized with git
- [ ] All changes are committed

## Best Practices

For comprehensive best practices on organization, versioning, distribution, and collaboration, see `reference/best-practices.md`.

## Key Takeaways

### Marketplace Essentials
1. Marketplace manifest MUST be at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (not root)
2. Each plugin entry needs `name`, `source`, and optionally `description`
3. Plugin sources can be local paths (`./plugin`), GitHub repos (`github:user/repo`), or Git URLs
4. Add marketplace once: `/plugin marketplace add <path-or-url>`
5. Install plugins: `/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name`

### Development Workflow
1. Create marketplace directory with `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
2. Add plugins with their own `plugin.json` manifests
3. Test locally before sharing: `/plugin marketplace add /local/path`
4. Use git for version control and distribution
5. Update workflow: uninstall → reinstall or restart Claude Code

### Distribution
1. Share via git repository URL or local path
2. Users add marketplace, then browse/install plugins
3. Marketplace can mix local and remote plugin sources
4. Use semantic versioning for both marketplace and plugins
5. Document installation and usage in README
